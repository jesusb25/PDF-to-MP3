Turn your PDF files into an MP3 for easy listening

## Description

I used a vanilla web development stack including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the front end. I utilized express to create a backend restful API, and render.com to host it.

In the future, I would like to add more natural voices to the project. Error checking is in place for invalid parameters.


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
Best for Node Version 18 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jesusb25/PDF-to-MP3.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start local server
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
This will still make calls to external API but the server functions can be found in server.js

### Dependencies

Requires Node version 18
