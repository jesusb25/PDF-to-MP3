## Description

I employed a web development stack encompassing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to craft the frontend interface. The backend restful API was constructed using express, and for hosting, render.com was employed.

Looking ahead, an enhancement I'm considering involves incorporating additional natural voices into the project. To ensure robustness, comprehensive error-checking mechanisms have been implemented to handle invalid parameters effectively.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
Best for Node Version 18 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jesusb25/PDF-to-MP3.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start local server
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
This will still make calls to external API but the server functions can be found in server.js

### Dependencies

Requires Node version 18
